## RECOMMENDAtIONs
Utilization rate in the FCT is comparatively low. Possible solutions to remedy this include:

  Make sure that the ATMs are visible and accessible to customers. This could involve relocating the ATMs to more prominent locations, installing signage, or improving lighting and landscaping around the ATMs.

  Offer incentives to customers such as waived transaction fees or cashback rewards.

  Use various marketing channels to promote the availability and convenience of the ATM to customers, such as through social media, email newsletters, or in-branch promotions.

  Consider offering additional services at the ATM, such as the ability to deposit checks or make cash withdrawals in different denominations.

  Conduct surveys or use customer analytics to understand the preferences and habits of customers who use the ATM, and tailor the ATM's services and features to better meet their needs.
